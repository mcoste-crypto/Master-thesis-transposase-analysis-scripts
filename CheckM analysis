# This script is to perform the checkm lineage workflow on multiple genomes based on a list of NCBI accession numbers. This workflow was performed on all genomes that didn't have CHeckM quality values uploaded to NCBI. The following bash script was submitted as a bash job to the Harvard High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

#SBATCH -c 8                # Number of cores (-c)
#SBATCH -t 0-06:00          # Runtime in D-HH:MM, minimum of 10 minutes
#SBATCH -p sapphire   # Partition to submit to
#SBATCH --mem=1000000          # Memory pool for all cores (see also --mem-per-cpu)
